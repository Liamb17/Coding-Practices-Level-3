What if I said that randomness, coincidence, chance, karma, miracle—all such notions do not exist? That from the moment a being is born, their future is already carved into stone?
If so, a being’s actions do not truly stem from his own choices, but are manipulated to suit the performance of a “conductor”. In that sense—prayer, perfection and imperfection, reality and dream, hope and despair, righteousness and wickedness, love and hatred and even life and death are but illusionary concepts—equally and utterly devoid of meaning.
